# iGEM-model
There are two tools that you may use to aid you with your experiment design
The first one is the primerGetter, which you input two .dna files, one with the entire DNA bases, and one with the target DNA part. Then the program will output a .dna file with the base pairs of primers (left and right each 40 pairs). 
The second one is the resultPlamid, which you input two .dna files, one with the pairs on the plasmid, one with your target DNA. Then the program will output a .dna file with the final plasmid pairs in it, so you can check your result with DNA sequencing.
